## [Challenge #8 - Puppet](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/8.html)

There's a huge lending pool borrowing Damn Valuable Tokens (DVTs), where you first need to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. The pool currently has 100000 DVTs in liquidity.

There's a DVT market opened in an [Uniswap v1 exchange](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V1/introduction), currently with 10 ETH and 10 DVT in liquidity.

Starting with 25 ETH and 1000 DVTs in balance, you must steal all tokens from the lending pool.


## Solutions

### Self

The nice thing about [Zuhaib Mohammed](https://zuhaibmd.medium.com/damn-vulnerable-defi-challenge-8-puppet-18721340245c)'s blog post is that it only outlines the process, the steps, which should be taken, but does not actually show the solution. It is up to me to figure out how to get the step done.

This proposed solution was OK. But I think it was over simplified, and I would like something that helps me understand what is going on over something that just solves the challenge.
