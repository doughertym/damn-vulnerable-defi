## [Challenge #9 - Puppet v2](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/9.html)

The developers of the [last lending pool](Puppet) are saying that they've learned the lesson. And just released a new version!

Now they're using a [Uniswap v2 exchange](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/introduction) as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The new lending pool has a million DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do ;)

This one was not very helpful this time. It did outline the steps needed, but I could not figure out how to use the Uniswap functions on my own. I might have been able to do that if I had not been as tired as I was.

This was very helpful. But after reading this, I realized I likely could have figured it out on my own if I had not been so tired when I did the challenge.
