I would like to keep this repo up-to-date with the forked repo ([tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi](https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi)) and I might like to do these more than once for practice the challenge. So what I've decided to do today (18/Dec/2023) is create my own main branch called `doughertym/main` which will always stay in sync with the forked repo:branch. I can add my own files and notes, but will not add solutions to this branch. Solutions will got in a child branch to this called something like `doughertym/solutions-v2`, etc. These will not be merged up so as not to corrupt the main branch. But of course child branches can be created as needed and them merged back to the top _solutions_ branch.
